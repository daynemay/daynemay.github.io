I'm an Australian software developer, living and working in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

I've blogged off and on for a lot of years now, and over that time, my blog has gone through a lot of incarnations. This latest is a Jekyll installation served out of my GitHub account. Early days, but it seems pretty sweet so far.

Don't expect anything too exciting here; if I stay true to form, you'll see: the occasional write-up of a hike, run, trip or whatever; recipes (both kitchen and code) that I want to remember later; ruminations on software development esoterica, TV, the expat experience, and other such assorted miscellany - i.e. mostly just boring nonsense for the couple of dozen people on Earth who'd notice if I winked out of existence. If you're one of them: Hi!
