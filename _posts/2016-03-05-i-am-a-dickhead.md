*Preamble:* this is a long and winding tale that kind of peters out at the end, but it's a thing that happened today, so that's what you get. You've been warned.

Last night, Marcia went curling with her work, then walked over to the nearby pub, the Lion's Head. I met her and her work friends there when I left work, had a few drinks and walked home; Marcia stayed a while longer, then walked home too. Later in the night, it snowed heavily.

This morning, while we're lying in bed, she starts working on *me* to trudge back through last night's heavy snowfall to get the car - and to pick up some Gatorade and snacks on the way. I eventually agree, on the condition that she says, out loud, "I am a dickhead." She complies, so I dig the car keys out of her coat and walk to the pub, listening to the podcast Startup as I go. When I get to the Lion's Head, the car is nowhere in sight.

I call Marcia over the sound of the guy ploughing the snow in the car park - "So I'm here... *where* is the car?" I had misunderstood, thinking the car was at the pub, when it was in fact still at the curling rink. We straighten that out, and I walk over to the curling rink, stopping at the servo to grab the Gatorade. I then walk into Tim Horton's for snacks and coffee, and realise I somehow don't have the car keys any more. I pat myself down, take off my gloves so I can check my pockets properly with my bare hands, go back and asked the guy at the servo if I left them there - nothing.

I call Marsh again, ask her to check that I had *actually* taken the keys with me, then I figure they probably fell out of my pocket when I took my phone out to make that first call from the car park at the Lion's Head. I walk back there - nervous that if I *had* dropped them there, the guy might have picked them up with the plough, and now they're buried three feet into a snowbank. But I'm in luck - there they are, dark and easy to spot again the thin layer of snow remaining.

I snatch them up, walk back past the servo, tap on the glass and hold up the keys - the guy and I exchange thumbs-ups. I tuck the keys back in my pocket and set forth for the car again. I want to keep listening to Startup, so I futz with my earbuds trying to get them back in my ears, but my fat gloved hands aren't up to it. I take off the gloves, stuff them in my pocket and get the earbuds situated right. To manage this with my hands full of Gatorades and snacks and coffees, I'm holding the Tim's bag in my teeth and have the drink tray sitting on my forearms leaning against my chest - it's all a little precarious, but it works out: coffee stays in the cups, sandwiches stay in the bag. Victory. I eventually reach the car, and am like - *wait, have I dropped these fucking things somewhere again?!*  And yep, it sure seems that way. In retrospect, it must have been with all the fucking around to get the earbuds in.

I put my shit on top of the car, do the old pat-down routine, blah blah blah. I wander back and forth like six times between the car and the servo - where I *definitely* had them, cos I showed them to the guy and we thumbs-upped. I'm peering at the ground the whole time, no doubt looking more and more crazy with each lap, and certainly feeling it - who the *fuck* loses their keys *twice* in 15 minutes?! I run into the servo guy when he's on a smoke break and I tell him my tale of woe. He asks - genuinely, not like a prick: "are you stoned?" to which I reply "not at all - maybe a little hungover, if anything." He's sympathetic. I leave him and get back to my laps. I realise the thing I said before, about fucking around with the earbuds, but even retracing my steps from when I was doing that turns up nothing.

Eventually I give up the search, leave the food and coffee to keep cooling on top of the car and walk into Tim's to warm up and get an actual *hot* coffee. The guy there is the same guy who was serving me when I realised I'd lost the keys, y'know... the *first* time. He asks if I found them, I sheepishly tell him, "yep, and then I somehow managed to lose them again like a goddamn idiot." He too is sympathetic - enough to bump my medium black up to a large.

I sit there, sipping my large coffee and pondering when exactly I lost my mind and everything came off the rails. I walk home with that sad Charlie Brown music from Arrested Development - and I guess from Charlie Brown - playing in my mind.

At home, I grab the spare key, but it's always been a bit dodgy - it sets off the car alarm not always, but under some fuzzy confluence of circumstance that I haven't managed to suss out yet. But it's all I've got at this point, so I head back to the car with hopes of dodging that fuzzy confluence of circumstance.

You see where this is going.

I get to the car, hit the button - unlock! Hooray! - and open the door. The alarm - inevitably - goes off. I get in and try to start it anyway, hoping that'll trigger some override or something. But nope: it won't start and the alarm keeps doing its thing. The alarm finally cuts out of its own accord. I try again to start the car, and the alarm starts back up again. I pop open the interior fuse panel and hunt for the fuse marked "ALARM" or "HORN". There *is* no fuse marked "ALARM" or "HORN". I fish out the owner's manual to see if there's a diagram showing the "HORN" fuse in the exterior fuse panel under the bonnet/hood. There *is* a fuse marked "HORN" on that. That's awesome. I pop the bonnet and locate the fuse panel. It's covered with a plastic cover that would be trivial to pop off ordinarily, but with the snow that blew in from under the car overnight, and my fat-fingered gloved hands or snap-frozen bare hands, it's tough. I stick with bare hands, blow the snow off, and try to figure out the mechanism, but I can't get it going. I pour one of the not-yet-frozen coffees over the cover to clear off the snow, and eventually manage to pry it off - alarm going off right in my goddamn face the entire time. I spot a relay marked "HORN" and yank that. The alarm keeps on keeping on, so when I spot a fuse also marked "HORN", I yank that too. The alarm is still going gangbusters, and I'm out of ideas at this point. I get back in the car, yell "fuck" one time as loud as I can, and chill for a bit. Eventually the alarm falls silent.

I get on my phone and start Googling. Apparently, with a lot of car alarms, if you *manually* unlock the car - with the key, *not* with the keyless remote - that will chill the fucking thing out. So I put the key in the ignition, roll it around to "Accessories" in the hope that not going all the way to "Start" will avoid triggering the alarm. Small victory: that works. So I use the power windows to roll down the driver's side window, then I reach out and use the key to lock/unlock the door a few times then try the ignition again. The alarm - inevitably, again - goes off.

OK, fuck this. I call the CAA and inflict my stupid story on the friendly, helpful woman who answers. I spare her most of that shit I've subjected you to so far, about my fucking premature dementia or whatever the fuck it is. But I give her the salient details, and she tells me, because of the condition of the roads, we're looking at sixty to ninety minutes. OK, that's a bit shit, but whatever.

Another small victory: the guy arrives in like ten minutes.

I do the power windows thing again, wave to him, and when he gets out and walks over to me, I give him the executive summary. He asks me for the keys, so I hand them over, seeing where this is going. He takes them, puts the key in the door, flips it locked-unlocked-locked-unlocked a few times, hands them back to me and gives me a "Try it now." 

The car - inevitably - starts.

I get out and shake his hand "thanks". He tells me that the car - a 2006 Hyundai Accent - didn't come with a factory alarm, so I should take it in and get that half-arsed after-market alarm ripped out; the car's not chipped, and should start with any key that was cut to fit the lock, so the alarm's clearly fucking up. So... I guess I'll do that.

In any case, it wasn't what I would have chosen to do with six hours of my Saturday, but sometimes that's the way it goes, I guess.
